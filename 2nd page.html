    <h1>Journey with Developer Sam</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, Iâ€™m Sam â€” a passionate web developer who loves bringing ideas to life through clean design and efficient code.
      On this website, youâ€™ll find my projects, insights, and my journey as I grow as a developer.
      Whether youâ€™re here to collaborate, learn, or get inspired, welcome aboard!
    </p>

  <!-- Section 2: About -->
  <section id="about">
    <h1>About This Website</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Developer Sam</strong> was built to share my creative process, my projects, and my thoughts about coding and technology.
      Itâ€™s more than a portfolio â€” itâ€™s a learning space and a personal record of growth.
      As I improve, this site will grow with me, one line of code at a time.
    </p>

    <h1>Vision & Goals</h1>
    <p>
      My vision for this platform is simple: to build a digital space where anyone, from beginners to tech enthusiasts, can find something valuable.  
Whether itâ€™s learning a new web concept, exploring clean design, or seeing how projects evolve from scratch â€” this site is about <em>sharing the process, not just the results</em>.
<br><br>
Every section of this website represents a step forward â€” from my early experiments in HTML to the more advanced projects Iâ€™ll share in the future.  
Itâ€™s a growing story of progress, curiosity, and passion for coding.
<br><br>
As the site develops, I plan to include tutorials, project showcases, and insights that can help others begin their own developer journey.  
Together, weâ€™ll learn, build, and inspire.
</p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>
To create a platform where learning web development feels exciting, creative, and achievable for everyone.  
We aim to make technology simple, approachable, and full of possibilities.
</p>

<h2>Core Values</h2>
<ul>
  <li>ðŸ’¡ Curiosity â€” always keep learning and exploring.</li>
  <li>ðŸ§  Simplicity â€” great design comes from clarity.</li>
  <li>ðŸš€ Growth â€” every line of code is a step forward.</li>
</ul>
